# DCP Logo Moe Moe Project

## Overview

The [**Human Cell Atlas**](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) (HCA) is an ambitious project to

> create comprehensive reference maps of all human cells—the fundamental units of life—as a basis for both understanding human health and diagnosing, monitoring, and treating disease.

This involves generating a lot of biological data from high-throughput genomics and imaging technologies.
Organization and analysis of HCA data is the responsibility of the [**Data Coordination Platform**](https://www.humancellatlas.org/data-sharing) (DCP).
The DCP implements a computational architecture for data processing, all the way from ingestion to exploration.

## Problem statement 

The current logo for the HCA is this rather boring image:

For the DCP itself, there is the snooze-inducing diagram here:

I also have a T-shirt where the parts of the HCA logo are colored using the box colors in the DCP schematic.
It's a nice shirt, but, all in all, I think we can agree that it's not very inspiring.

If I had one major criticism about these images, it's that they're not moe enough.
By contrast, even Kyoto City can make public transport cute:

Our task here is to improve the DCP logo by making it more anime.

## Solution

We want to search the "literature" for an anthropomorphized representation of each DCP box.
This requires a show with a main cast of five who have color-coded themes according to the DCP box colors above.
We are also looking for moe, which restricts the most likely genres to comedy or slice of life.

For any serious anime watcher, the constraints above should immediately suggest one show in particular.
Yes, that's right - [**Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21273/Gochuumon_wa_Usagi_Desu_ka) (GochiUsa), or "Is the Order a Rabbit?".

I shouldn't need to say more, but I will.
For the uninitiated, GochiUsa is a show about the day-to-day lives of several friends working in cafes in a small European-ish town.
It is a relaxing show - if very saccharine - and nothing bad ever happens, which makes it perfect for representing the DCP.

## Honorable mentions

[**Joshiraku**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku) also has a main cast of five, but the colors don't quite fit.
